    <div class="text">
      <p> A student aspiring to become a software engineer, driven by an appetite to learn and the rush of solving puzzles. I enjoy taking an idea from immagination to reality by using my knowledge of computers and the grit to chase down bugs and fix what's broken.  </p>
      <p> Formally I have worked with PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SQL. I have explored Node.js, React.js, Flutter Framework, Python and Java (Android Studio) to work on personal projects to accomplish my ideas.</p>
      <p> I would like to learn how to develop APIs using Node.js or GraphQL and create APIs that can automate the physical process of mail delivery. I wish to be more familiar with back-end development using Node.js and get experience in creating applications. </p>
